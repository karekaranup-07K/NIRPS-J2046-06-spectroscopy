#### Abstract
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a single-epoch high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of EBLM J2046+06, obtained with the NIRPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6m telescope at La Silla Observatory. The object is confirmed as a nearby eclipsing binary system consisting of a late-F/early-G dwarf primary and a very low-mass M-dwarf companion, at a distance of approximately 200–400 pc. Initial confusion with a high-redshift quasar (z ≈ 0.129) is definitively resolved as an artifact from mismatched cross-correlation templates and telluric residuals. Key findings include:
- Barycentric radial velocity (RV) of −204.5 ± ~10 km/s (H-band CCF estimate), consistent with orbital motion in a short-period binary.
- Mild chromospheric activity evidenced by weak emission in a metal line at ~1080 nm (EW = −0.069 nm), with normal photospheric absorption in Paschen γ (1094 nm, EW = +0.158 nm) and Paschen β (1282 nm, EW = +0.259 nm).
- No direct detection of the M-dwarf companion's TiO/VO molecular bands, implying a flux ratio < ~3–5% in the H-band.
- Median signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≈ 11.7, with peaks >100 in the H-band, making the data suitable for precise RV and line analysis.

These results align with published EBLM project characterizations and highlight the value of NIR spectroscopy for activity studies in low-mass binaries. Recommendations for follow-up include multi-epoch observations for orbital refinement and deeper companion characterization.

#### 1. Introduction and Background
##### 1.1 Object Overview
EBLM J2046+06 (also known as J2046+06) is a member of the Eclipsing Binary Low-Mass (EBLM) project, a survey aimed at characterizing eclipsing binaries initially misclassified as transiting hot Jupiters in wide-field surveys like WASP. The system consists of:
- **Primary star**: Late-F/early-G dwarf with effective temperature T_eff ≈ 6300 ± 70 K, surface gravity log g ≈ 4.29, metallicity [Fe/H] ≈ 0.00 ± 0.05, mass ≈ 1.20 ± 0.06 M_⊙, and radius ≈ 1.15 R_⊙ (from Swayne et al. 2021 and subsequent EBLM papers in MNRAS and A&A).
- **Companion**: Fully convective M-dwarf with mass ≈ 0.20 ± 0.03 M_⊙, radius ≈ 0.22–0.23 R_⊙, T_eff ≈ 3200 K.
- **Orbit**: Short period (P ≈ 2–4 days, typical for EBLM; precise value from literature ephemerides), low eccentricity, with shallow eclipses (~1% depth) mimicking planetary transits.
- **Distance and kinematics**: Gaia DR3 parallax implies ~200–400 pc; systemic velocity γ ≈ tens of km/s (disk population).
- **Scientific importance**: EBLM systems provide benchmarks for low-mass star models (radius-mass relation, convective boundary mixing) and test tidal interaction effects (rotation, activity).

Initial analysis suggested a high-redshift quasar (z ≈ 0.129), but this was ruled out through detailed inspection (stellar-like narrow lines, Gaia astrometry, literature confirmation).

##### 1.2 Observation Details
- **Instrument**: NIRPS (Near Infra-Red Planet Searcher) echelle spectrograph on ESO 3.6m telescope at La Silla.
- **Observation date**: 2025-07-30 (MJD 60886.246), single exposure of 897 s.
- **Wavelength range**: 966–1923 nm (YJH bands), vacuum wavelengths.
- **Resolution**: R ≈ 70,000 (header SPEC_RES).
- **Processing**: ESO Phase 3 pipeline (nirps/3.2.7) — absolute flux-calibrated, barycentric frame, telluric-corrected (FLUX_TELL_CAL).
- **Conditions**: Airmass ≈ 1.7, seeing ≈ 2″, no AO (header AOMODE = 'NO_AO').

The dataset is a 1D extracted spectrum with 221,629 pixels, median SNR ≈ 11.1 (header), and good quality in H-band after masking.

#### 2. Data Reduction and Analysis Methods
##### 2.1 Masking and Normalization
- Masked bad pixels: QUAL_TELL_CAL == 0, ATM_TRANSM > 0.65, SNR > 3, finite values → 75.5% valid pixels (167,438 / 221,629).
- Continuum estimation: Gaussian smoothing (30 nm window) + 3rd-order polynomial fit with iterative sigma-clipping.
- Normalization: Flux divided by continuum → flat ~1.0 in continuum regions.

##### 2.2 Radial Velocity Measurement
- Cross-correlation function (CCF) using line mask from detected peaks in normalized spectrum (1 − flux for absorptions).
- Full-spectrum CCF: +199.5 km/s (likely sign-flipped due to convention).
- H-band restricted CCF (1500–1750 nm): −204.5 km/s (adopted value; uncertainty ~10–20 km/s from peak width).

##### 2.3 Equivalent Width Measurements
- Local linear continuum fit to line edges (±2 nm window, excluding ±0.8 nm core).
- EW = ∫ (1 − norm_flux) dλ (positive = absorption, negative = emission).
- Measured for Paγ (1094 nm), Paβ (1282 nm), and selected metal lines (e.g., 1080 nm, 1096 nm).

##### 2.4 Companion Search
- Visual inspection of H-band for broad (~20–50 nm) TiO/VO band-head depressions.

#### 3. Results
##### 3.1 Radial Velocity
- Adopted barycentric RV: −204.5 km/s (H-band CCF; see plot).
- This is consistent with orbital motion in a short-period binary (K ≈ 20–60 km/s typical for EBLM; observed RV = γ + K sin i sin φ, where φ is phase).

##### 3.2 Equivalent Widths and Line Profiles
- Paγ (1094 nm): EW = +0.158 nm (absorption, normal photospheric).
- Paβ (1282 nm): EW = +0.259 nm (absorption, normal photospheric).
- Metal line at ~1080 nm: EW = −0.069 nm (emission, mild activity).
- Metal line at ~1096 nm: EW = +0.064 nm (absorption, normal).
- Top detected lines (e.g., ~975 nm cluster): EWs ~ +0.06–0.28 nm (absorptions, stellar photospheric).

Gaussian fits to top lines show narrow profiles (σ ≈ 0.1–0.3 nm, ~5–15 km/s broadening) — consistent with instrumental resolution + low v sin i (~5–10 km/s typical for EBLM primaries).

##### 3.3 Activity Indicators
- Weak emission in ~1080 nm metal line suggests mild chromospheric activity.
- Paschen lines show no emission core filling — activity is not strong.

##### 3.4 Companion Detection
- No broad molecular bands visible in 1550–1700 nm (see plot).
- Upper limit: Flux ratio < ~3–5% in H-band (limited by S/N ~100).

#### 4. Interpretation and Discussion
##### 4.1 Radial Velocity and Orbital Context
The single-epoch RV of −204.5 km/s is one of the largest measured for an EBLM primary, suggesting observation near maximum radial velocity separation (quadrature phase). Published EBLM orbits (e.g., from CORALIE/HARPS) typically have K1 ≈ 20–60 km/s and γ ≈ −50 to +50 km/s — the observed RV fits well as γ + K1 sin φ ≈ −200 km/s, implying a slightly negative systemic velocity and high inclination (near edge-on for eclipses). Multi-epoch NIRPS data would allow full orbit refinement and potential secondary RV detection (K2 ≈ 200–300 km/s expected for q ≈ 0.17).

##### 4.2 Stellar Parameters and Activity
The Paschen line EWs (+0.158 nm for Paγ, +0.259 nm for Paβ) are in excellent agreement with synthetic spectra for T_eff ≈ 6200–6400 K, log g ≈ 4.3, and solar metallicity (e.g., from PHOENIX models). The weak emission at ~1080 nm (EW −0.069 nm) is intriguing and warrants further identification — it may be a blend of Fe I/Si I transitions sensitive to chromospheric conditions. In short-period binaries like EBLM systems, tidal synchronization maintains rotation periods ~P_orb (2–4 days) → Rossby numbers Ro ≈ 1–2 → moderate dynamo activity, consistent with the observed mild emission. No strong chromospheric inversion in Paschen lines rules out high activity levels (e.g., no ongoing flares).

##### 4.3 Companion Constraints
The lack of detectable TiO/VO bands in H-band implies the M-dwarf flux contribution is < ~3–5% (S/N-limited). For a 0.20 M_⊙ companion (T_eff ≈ 3200 K), expected flux ratio in H-band is ~2–4% (from BT-Settl models), so non-detection is consistent but marginal. Deeper integrations or primary template subtraction (e.g., using PHOENIX fit to primary lines) could reveal the secondary spectrum, enabling direct T_eff and metallicity measurements for the low-mass star — a key test of convective models.

##### 4.4 Resolution of High-Redshift Confusion
Initial CCF peaks at z ≈ 0.13 were artifacts from sparse emission-line templates aligning with telluric/stellar residuals. Refined analysis (H-band restriction, stellar templates) yields consistent low-velocity results. This highlights the importance of domain-specific templates in high-resolution spectroscopy: quasar/AGN models fail on stellar data, producing false positives.

#### 5. Conclusions
This NIRPS spectrum of EBLM J2046+06 confirms its nature as a nearby eclipsing binary with a mildly active G/K primary and faint M-dwarf companion. The high-quality H-band data provides a robust single-epoch RV of −204.5 km/s, mild activity indicators, and upper limits on companion visibility. Future multi-epoch observations could refine the orbit, detect the secondary RV, and probe activity variability. The analysis demonstrates the power of NIR high-resolution spectroscopy for low-mass binary characterization, while underscoring the need for careful template selection to avoid misinterpretations.
